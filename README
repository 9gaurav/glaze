Glaze:
What started as a weekend project idea on one lazy September weekend , resulted in Glaze: a simple doodling app that runs on all the platforms!
It is light weight, uses HTML5 and is compatible with:
- Mac
- Windows
- Android
- iOS 


I wished to convert this into a native Android app. But never found time to do so.
I hope someone will do that. :)

Enjoy doodling!

Few known bugs:
-Saving doodle might not work on some devices
-Color picker lag 
-Other known bugs and issues
